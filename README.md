# Neural Networks Color Bias Test
In this project there are four neural networks.
Each network uses four tests to examine the color bias and resolution of the networks.
The tests are: lossy compression, adding gaussian noise, gaussian blurring and deleting the center image information.
Each of the tests examines different aspects for color bias.
